# PairPlayers v0.02

### Introduction
PairPlayers was made in a hurry where we needed to sort out all possible combinations of
matchups in Classic Tetris League (CTL), before going live. 

This is an extremly simple script that will take a list of players, and return
all the combinations, in groupings of 2. 

### Update history
v0.02 release (March 27 2022)
  - The script now takes inputs, so don't have to type them into the
    actual script yourself.

### Todos
- Actually make it useful for anyone (for now only a script)
- Make it possible to choose if Restreamer gonng do a 2-way or 4-way restream
- Make it a web app?

*PS! I'm still learning Python, some of those todos might or might nothappen in near future!*
